How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff shows the difference between two files. By examining the difference between a working file and one with a bug you are able to locate what has changed between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would allow a programmer to rollback changes that he/she made that introduced a bug. Could also act as a backup file incase someone removed code and saved the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

When writting code many times I zone out all other thoughts and will forget to commit as often as I should.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because the others are not specific to writing applications or code.

This is the change I made.
